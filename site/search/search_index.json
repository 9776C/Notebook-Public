This has many advantages: The code will be very clean and organized, I can avoid or solve problems we had with the old code, I could add and expand our code more easily, and importantly, it would also mean we could change development environments. We have been using VexCode through Visual Studio Code up until now, but we will be changing to PROS. PROS is open source, more comprehensive, and well maintained. These qualities and more make it a better choice than the VexCode development environment. PROS also has better library support. Some of these libraries are made for autonomous, which we feel like could help us when we add an autonomous.\u200b</p>"},{"location":"pages/time-based/02-bear-madison/code/01-clean-up/#implement","title":"Implement:","text":"<p>I rewrote all of the functionality we had in VexCode in PROS instead. I also made many improvements. The main improvement fixed how some of our button inputs are handled. On the old code, all the button inputs were handled differently than normal; they would do a \u201ctoggle hold\u201d. A \u201chold\u201d button performs an action for as long as you hold the button, while a \u201ctoggle\u201d button performs the action when you press the button, then stops the next time you press the button. Our \u201ctoggle hold\u201d buttons were a combination of both strategies with a threshold to decide whether the press was a \u201ctoggle\u201d or a \u201chold\u201d. We had all the buttons set up this way when we wrote the code. But we then changed a few of the to the more normal button approaches later during a competition because \u201ctoggle hold\u201d was not as useful for some of our functions. In the new code, I made a header file that handles this better. We start by defining a button state for the button we want to use, e.g., TOGGLE, HOLD, or TOGGLE_HOLD. Then, every cycle of the main loop, we tell the code the current state of the button; on or off. It takes that input, the previous state, and the button type and then returns true if the function should be active, or false if it should not be active. This make the code much cleaner and organized. It also makes it very easy to add another button in later.\u200b</p>"},{"location":"pages/time-based/02-bear-madison/code/01-clean-up/#test","title":"Test:","text":"<p>Almost all the code I added worked perfectly, including the new header.

Another solution would be to prioritize the newest intake button press. This would make it so any time an intake button is pressed, the corresponding function is done, regardless of other active intake buttons.\u200b</p>"},{"location":"pages/time-based/02-bear-madison/code/02-intake-buttons/#select","title":"Select:","text":"<p>I chose prioritizing the newest button press.

I added another section, separate from the button type section, that handles priority stacks. I codded in a counter system that counts up every cycle of the main loop. Then, when a new button is pressed, (It checks by seeing if the button was not previously active and is now active), it records the time when the button was pressed by setting a variable equal to the current value of the counter. Then, every loop, it finds the button counter with the highest value and checks to see if the corresponding button is still in an active state. If it is not, it goes to the next highest highest counter and checks its button state, and so on. This satisfies our original problem by checking the button that was most recently pressed first. But it also solves another problem. With a highest counter system like this, the code always sets the button that was most recently pressed as the active state. This works intuitively 90% of the time, but if we were to be holding a button, and then while still holding that button, accidentally bump another button, the code would set the new button as the active state, as expected. However, after releasing the button, the code would just stop the action, regardless of the fact that the first button is still pressed. So, by checking the next highest button counter when the button with highest counter is inactive, we solve this problem. This makes it so if we press and release a button while another one is still held, the code would go back to the old button\u2019s function. </p>"},{"location":"pages/time-based/02-bear-madison/code/02-intake-buttons/#test","title":"Test:","text":"<p>When testing, the system appears to work perfectly, but if we logically think about the code, we can identify a minor problem.

I could replace the counter with a different system entirely, perhaps a system that rearranges the button priorities.

Subtracting would work by making sure would never be able to reach the maximum value.

This method worked decently well and was able to move a lot of blocks pretty quickly. But had some issues:</p> <ol> <li>Rubber band entanglement - The intake relied on rubber bands, which were really good at intaking but would get entangled with other bots. This would either:<ul> <li>Break the rubber bands completely</li> <li>Make our bot stuck to the opponent for the rest of the match</li> </ul> </li> <li>Jamming when overheated - The system would jam if the motors got too hot during extended use</li> <li>Size - The system was almost or more than half the bot and we couldn't fit under the goal</li> <li>Middle/Bottom goal - The old system could barely score in the middle goal if at all, and could only really score one block at a time in the bottom goal.</li> </ol>"},{"location":"pages/time-based/04-wasatch-future/new-scoring/00-overview/#what-worked-well","title":"What Worked Well:","text":"<ul> <li>Fast block movement</li> <li>Effective intake (when not entangled)</li> <li>Generally consistent performance under normal conditions</li> </ul>"},{"location":"pages/time-based/04-wasatch-future/new-scoring/00-overview/#goals-for-new-scoring-system","title":"Goals for New Scoring System:","text":"<ul> <li>Extremely fast scoring capability</li> <li>More reliable (jamming)</li> <li>No overheating issues under full match load</li> <li>Ability to score specific quantities of blocks (important for autonomous)</li> <li>Color sorting capability for strategic play</li> <li>Fit under long goal</li> </ul>"},{"location":"pages/time-based/04-wasatch-future/new-scoring/00-overview/#brainstorm","title":"Brainstorm:","text":""},{"location":"pages/time-based/04-wasatch-future/new-scoring/00-overview/#research-current-meta","title":"Research - Current Meta:","text":"<p>Looking at top-performing bots at competitions, we've identified several effective scoring mechanisms:</p> <ol> <li>Basket - What we used before, moderate speed</li> <li>Lever - Currently the fastest method (6 blocks in ~0.5 seconds)</li> <li>S-bot -</li> <li>C-bot - </li> </ol>"},{"location":"pages/time-based/04-wasatch-future/new-scoring/00-overview/#dual-chamber-idea","title":"Dual-Chamber Idea:","text":"<p>Regardless of which mechanism we choose, we're considering using 2 scoring chambers side-by-side that converge into one output point.
