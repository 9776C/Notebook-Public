### Identify: 
We need to find the fastest & best way of scoring, therefore winning. 
### Brainstorm: 
We could make a super fast-moving bot that runs back and forth, we could make a stronger bot, a bit slower but scores lots at a time.
### Select: 
We chose the stronger bot because it is less likely for its purpose to be ruined in-match. It's more sturdy, and we can design several different mechanisms to score faster at a different time, and on different pages.
### Build: 
My team did much more of the building than I did. I helped build whenever I had time in my schedule. But eventually, we did get a sturdy bot.
### Test: 
Going to several competitions, we were able to qualify for state, and get a good idea of what works for all teams and what doesn't.
### Repeat: 
After going to competitions, we saw that a bot that holds more blocks and is sturdy tends to do well. It's objectives don't get ruined in the short term very often.
