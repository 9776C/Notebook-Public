For our new bot we need a new drivetrain

# Identify:

### Problems with our old drivetrain:
1. Not enough space for lock nuts on the screw joints, and the nuts would sometimes loosen and absolutely bork the drive. 
2. It was a little tipsy (a bit too fast and top heavy)
3. Odom barely fit
4. It was very hard to park (and it broke the tracking wheels one time)
5. We didn't have a lot of pushing power

### Things that were good about our drivetrain:

1. It wasn't too slow
2. It was generally a good drivetrain, only minor things

### Things we want on the new drivetrain:

1. A possible PTO option (still being explored)
2. No overheating under full-match load
3. A good balance of speed (between **65–80 in/s**)
4. A slim frame that doesn’t waste space
5. High resistance to being pushed around
6. Strong pushing power _against_ other bots
7. Low internal friction (efficient joints, accurate alignment)
8. The ability to park without breaking Odom tracking wheels
9. A longer-than-wide footprint (target: ~30 UN long)
10. Enough internal space for wiring, Odom, and subsystems
