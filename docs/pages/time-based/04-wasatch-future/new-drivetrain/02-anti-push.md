# Identify:
### Problem:
Our current bot can be pushed around more than I would like, we need a way to fix that.

# Brainstorm:
We need more traction and torque, mostly traction, as we cant really change torque as the speed is set in mostly dry clay.

Because speed (and torque is set) we need other solutions to help with pushing/being pushed.
Something that could help is adding angled skirts to edge of the drivetrain

 As shown in this diagram, if we have a slope on the edge of our bot if another bot tries to push us it would get lifted up losing the majority of its traction
 This also helps with pushing other bots, because when we go push someone else it will lift them up a little bit , making them lose their traction and pushing us into the ground giving us more traction (we might have a little bit of a hard time with traction because we are planning on making our robot light)

There is a problem with this however; to be most effective the skirts bust be close to the ground, and that will make it difficult to park, so we need a way to raise up the skirt, and if we add that ability, we might as well make it so we can push it into the ground making effectively immovable

This can also help with [Parking](04-parking.md); we could make it the same mechanism.

#### How do we actually do this?
We must figure out a way to physically do this.
