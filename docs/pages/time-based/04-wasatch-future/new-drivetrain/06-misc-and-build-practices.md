# Identify:

## Common problems with drivetrains:
- Friction
- Rigidity
- Clearance
- Squareness
- Center of Gravity (Tipping)
- Bent Axles
- Gear "Slop"
- Falling Apart 

We need to not have these problems.

## (Common) Solutions to these problems:

### Friction:

#### Screw Joints
Screw joints are a very common technique for reducing friction. 
The method of screw joints (on a drivetrain) is to connect a gear and a wheel together with screws like so: 
![screw joint wheel](/images/time-based/04-wasatch-future/new-drivetrain/screw-joint-wheel.png)
We do this so that we can use round inserts on the wheel but still be able to turn it (cuz we kinda need to drive). Using the round inserts allows us to use a screw instead of a axle witch is smoother and produces less friction.
#### Inserts
Building upon the idea of screw joints, the type of round insert matters. The best inserts are the round bronze inserts, these have a lot less friction than the plastic ones because they are smoother and are "gripped" less easily by the screw threads (when a lot of force is applied perpendicular to the screw, the threads can "cut" into the plastic and that creates a lot of friction)
This is an example of how good the bronze inserts are:

#### Bearings
Never put an axle on bare metal, even if the hole is round, it will wear down both the metal and the axle.

#### Lubricant
Some mechanisms benefit from lubrication to reduce friction and wear. A good rule of thumb: if a part squeaks, binds, or shows wear (like powder from plastic gears), it may need grease. For VEX parts, **white lithium grease** is safe and effective for metal and plastic (acetal) components. Apply **sparingly** *(ahem.. Zack... ahem....).*

#### No Bent stuff
Don't use bent parts (especially turney things).

### Rigidity:

#### Cross Bracing

#### Shoulder Screws


### Squareness:

#### Temporary alignment parts during assembly

#### Shoulder Screws


### Clearance:

#### Screw Head direction


### Center of Gravity:

#### Be Mindful of weight (distribution)


### Bent Axles:

#### Don't use them.
Really, I'm not kidding, DON'T USE BENT AXLES!


### Gear Slop:

#### Gear alignment on a 2.5 C-channel
