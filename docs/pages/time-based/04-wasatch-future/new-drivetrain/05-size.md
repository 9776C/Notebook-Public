# Identify:
We want a slim drivetrain, and ideally that would be 5 un wide, that worked with our old drivetrain because the gears fit inside the wheels:

But with the new gear ratio the gear does no fit in the wheel:

But it could still be squeezed into 3 un wide (5 with the c channels):

 But there is like no space (would be really hard to make not frictiony)

However, this would introduce a new problem, in order to keep the drivetrain low friction, we use screw joints
