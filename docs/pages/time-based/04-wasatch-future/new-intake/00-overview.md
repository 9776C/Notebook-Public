our current intake is using rubber bands to intake block, and is in a fixed position. it doesn't move up and down to let blocks in, the rubber bands just deform around the block. for the new intake we are thinking of either sticking with the rubber band intake, or switching to a flex wheel intake. a flex wheel intake is harder to make, as it has tighter tolerances of actually working, where rubber band intake requires almost no tuning. lets list out all the pros and cons

## Rubber band intake

### pros
- simple
- require no tuning
- can be static (not move up and down)
- have lost of grip.
### Cons
- gets entagled with other robots
- rubber bands can break and it goes through a lot of them
