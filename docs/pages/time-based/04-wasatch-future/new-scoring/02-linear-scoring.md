# Brainstorm:

One way to score blocks is using a linear mechanism to push the blocks. My idea is a little difficult to describe in words so here is a diagram:
![diagram](images/time-based/04-wasatch-future/new-scoreing/linear-scoring-diagram.png)

In the block chamber we have a liner rail and slide and on that slide we have something to push the blocks out the end. The slide would have elastic string attached to it that would be wound up but the PTO.

There would be 3 main states:

State 1: 
![state 1](/images/time-based/04-wasatch-future/new-scoreing/linear-state1.png)
In this state there is no tension on the elastic string or the block pusher thingy, but the latch holds the block pusher thingy from going forward.

State 2:
![state 1](/images/time-based/04-wasatch-future/new-scoreing/linear-state2.png)
State 2 is vary similar to state 2 except that the PTO has wound up the elastic string and stored the energy to be released by the latch

State 3:
![state 1](/images/time-based/04-wasatch-future/new-scoreing/linear-state3.png)State 3 is the same as state 2 but after the latch has been released but the string is still wound up.

After state 3 the PTO unwinds the elastic string and a small elastic pulls the slide back into the latch resetting to state 1

## Pros/cons
### Pros:
- Doesn't take up a lot of additional space
- Doesn't require a motor to actively use (to score blocks)
- Can release a lot more energy at once than a motor directly (it just takes time to wind up, the limit isn't torque it's time)
- Is extremely fast
- can be very lightweight

### Cons:
- Less efficient block storage (not curved)
- A bit complicated (ok, maybe a lot)
- Not super controllable
