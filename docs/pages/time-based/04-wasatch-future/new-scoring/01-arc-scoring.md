arc scoring is using a lever to push blocks along an arc-shaped path and into the goals.
![diagram](images/time-based/04-wasatch-future/new-scoreing/lever-arm.png)
The Way this would work is by using a PTO (Power Take off) to switch 2 of the drivetrain motors to  the levers(s), and rotate them along the arc, which would be full of blocks. this method has been proven to be able to score 6 blocks in 1/2 a second. This method of scoring is also know to jam a lot if its not build properly. 

## Pros
- Is extremely fast
- can score a specific amount of blocks, 1, 2 3, etc. this is important for things like autonomous period and skills autonomous, when you want to only score one or 2 blocks, and not everything you are holding. 
- can have variable speed, in case you want to launch the blocks really hard and fast to either de-score, or try and win a pushing match where there's 2 bots on opposing ends of goals just holding it, or if you want to score slowly to not shoot them through the middle goal.
- very lightweight
## cons
- can be weak if its not built for torque
- takes up more room than linear(harder to go under goals)
- can have issues with intaking if not built correctly
- 4 motor drive while scoring 
## conclusion
I think this is the better method of scoring due to the fact that linear isn't adjustable. like it cant vary the speed, or the amount of blocks it scores, its all or nothing. with the lever arm, you can do just about anything in terms of scoring. you can make it super slow to score, or you can make it launch the blocks out the other side of the long goal. for auton, you can score one or two in the middle, and the rest in the long goal, or if you want to get AWP, you can score 1 in the middle goal, go to match loader and score 2 in the long goal, then go to the other match loader and score all 6 into the other long goal, and use a wing to get control zone.  this give a insane head start to the rest of the match, with us already owning one goal.

# Arc Scoring

Arc scoring is using a lever to push blocks along an arc-shaped path and into the goals.

## How It Works:

The way this would work is by using a **PTO (Power Take Off)** to switch 2 of the drivetrain motors to the lever(s), and rotate them along the arc, which would be full of blocks. This method has been proven to be able to score **6 blocks in 1/2 a second**. This method of scoring is also known to jam a lot if it's not built properly.

## Pros:

- Is extremely fast
- Can score a specific amount of blocks (1, 2, 3, etc.) - this is important for things like autonomous period and skills autonomous, when you want to only score one or 2 blocks, and not everything you are holding
- Can have variable speed, in case you want to launch the blocks really hard and fast to either de-score, or try and win a pushing match where there's 2 bots on opposing ends of goals just holding it, or if you want to score slowly to not shoot them through the middle goal
- Very lightweight

## Cons:

- Can be weak if it's not built for torque
- Takes up more room than linear (harder to go under goals)
- Can have issues with intaking if not built correctly
- 4 motor drive while scoring

## Conclusion:

I think this is the better method of scoring due to the fact that linear isn't adjustable. Like it can't vary the speed, or the amount of blocks it scores, it's all or nothing. With the lever arm, you can do just about anything in terms of scoring. You can make it super slow to score, or you can make it launch the blocks out the other side of the long goal.

For auton, you can score one or two in the middle, and the rest in the long goal. Or if you want to get AWP, you can score 1 in the middle goal, go to match loader and score 2 in the long goal, then go to the other match loader and score all 6 into the other long goal, and use a wing to get control zone. This gives an insane head start to the rest of the match, with us already owning one goal.
