The code needs an update before the Madison competition.
# Identify:
## Current Capabilities:
1. We can drive the bot.
2. We can use all the pneumatics.
3. We can use the intake.
4. The intake state automatically changes the gate.
## Current Problems:
1. It is messy in general due to changes made quickly when noticing problems at the Madison Match.
2. There is multiple buttons that control the intake, but there is no functionality to deal with it.
## Additions Needed: 
1.  We need an autonomous.

# Sections:
 [[01-clean-up]] - No new functionality, just redoing the current functionality in a different framework.
